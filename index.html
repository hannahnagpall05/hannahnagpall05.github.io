                I’m an honors computer science student and former competitive tennis player,
                combining discipline from the court with curiosity in tech. I love building
                things, learning fast, and saying my story out loud instead of hiding it.

        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
            I’m Hannah, an international honors computer science student who loves turning ideas
            into real projects. Tennis taught me focus, resilience, and how to show up when
            it matters. Now I bring that same mindset to code, research, and every opportunity
            I get in tech and academia.
        </p>
        <p>
            I’m not shy about my story — I’m a first-gen young woman in tech, a high-achieving
            student, and someone who wants to make my work, my background, and my journey visible.
