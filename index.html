        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
            I’m Hannah Nagpall, an Honors Computer Science student at Texas A&M University–Kingsville,
            maintaining a 3.95 GPA while competing as a Division II student-athlete. My academic journey
            started at Alabama A&M University as a D1 tennis player before transferring to TAMUK to push
            myself both academically and athletically.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’ve gained industry exposure through an externship with The Home Depot and hands-on technical
            experience as an Application Development Intern at GSPANN Technologies, where I built a fully
            functional e-commerce application using Java and SQL. I also work as an Undergraduate Research
            Assistant in Raman Spectroscopy — running experiments, collecting spectral data, and learning
            data analysis in Python.
        </p>

        <p>
            With growing skills in Java, SQL, and backend development, I’m committed to building meaningful
            solutions and becoming a strong software engineer. Resilience, adaptability, and a little humor
            take you further than you think.

                    <p>
                        Raman Spectroscopy is a technique that reveals molecular structures by analyzing
                        how light scatters when it interacts with a sample. For this research project, 
                        I'll be performing hands-on Raman experiments, collecting spectral data, and 
                        building Python tools to clean, visualise, and interpret the results.
