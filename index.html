            <div class="section-body">
                <p>
                    I’m an honors computer science student with experience in software development,
                    externship programs, and leadership. I care about technology, problem-solving
                    and pushing myself academically and personally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tennis shaped how I work: discipline, consistency, and showing up when it’s
                    uncomfortable. Now that same mindset drives my approach to code, projects and
                    the opportunities I say yes to — research, internships, and anything that moves
                    me closer to becoming a strong software engineer.
